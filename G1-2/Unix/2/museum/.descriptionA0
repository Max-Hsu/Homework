As you board the train it immediately leaves the station.  It is a very
bumpy ride.  It is shaking from side to side, and up and down.  You
sit down in one of the chairs in order to be more comfortable.

Finally the train comes to a sudden stop, and the doors open, and some
force throws you out.  The train speeds away.
