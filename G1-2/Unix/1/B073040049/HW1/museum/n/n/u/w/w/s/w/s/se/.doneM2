You are at the intersection of Main Street and Maple Ave.  Main street
runs north and south, and Maple Ave runs east off into the distance.
If you look north and east you can see many intersections, but all of
the buildings that used to stand here are gone.  Nothing remains except
street signs.
There is a road to the northwest leading to a gate that guards a building.
