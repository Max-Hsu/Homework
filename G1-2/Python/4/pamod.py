# Homework 3
# Due: Sunday, June 16th at noon.
# What to submit: a file named <your_student_id>.pa3.py
# Beware: Don't cheat -- you will be caught and fail the class.
# Beware: Don't procrastinate -- you will be busy studying you other classes
#		 later next week.
# Beware: Don't not do it. Although not worth as many points as the previous
#		 assignment, it is still worth a lot of points.
# Beware: Don't procrastinate -- you will be busy studying for other classes
#		 later next week.
# Beware: Don't miss the deadline. Noon is 12:00. It is in the middle of the
#		 day not at night.

#From the above, there are 5 blanks for you to fill in:
# ___1___: This defines the constructor method
# ___2___: This lets W and B be treated as globals
# ___3___: This defines the dictionary named W. The values are the symbols for
#		  all of the 16 white pieces (so there are 8 "♟", 2 "♞", etc). The
#		  keys are tuples of (x,y) coordinates for the starting positions of
#		  these 6 pieces.
#		  -In this homework (1,1) is the lower-left corner (ie, a1) and (8,8)
#		   is the upper-right corner.
#		  -Note that the end of this line is: ,"♜♞♝♛♚♝♞♜♟♟♟♟♟♟♟♟")}. You must
#		   use this part precisely as written. You must put you answer on one
#		   line. And you cannot use semicolons (;).
#		  -Note that white goes at the bottom of the board (with its pieces
#		   located from (1,1) to (8,2)).
#		  -Note that the knights are next to the rooks (I had misplaced these
#		   knights on the previous homework).
#
# ___4___: This defines the dictionary named B for the 16 black pieces. As with
#		  ___3___, the end part of the line is given. Here, however, you have
#		  to use W as the basis for defining B. So this line can't use any
#		  quote or semicolon symbols.
#
# ___5___: Like ___1___, this line lets you write to a nonlocal variable (this
#		  time, that variable is "s".
#		  Note that this uses some functions from the PA2a.py file that I've
#		  provided.

				# This constructor takes 2 passed-in arguments (the x and y
				# coordinates of the position that this object will represent).
				# It then stores these coordinates into a tuple that is named
				# with a private name. As described in ___3___, the orientation
				# is such that (1,1) is in the lower-left of the board.

				# This method returns a single character. It is the unicode
				# symbol for the type of chess-piece at this board position.
				# If there is no piece here, it returns " ".
				# But consider: How do we know what piece is stored here?
				# The answer is you have to consult the W and B dictionaries.
				# Also, note that I've here said "...7..." instead of "___7___"
				# as a way of indicating that this can go on multiple lines.

						# This one expression is complicated, because it uses
					   # the technique of Lecture 12, Slide #4.
					   # Q: What does this method do?
					   # A: It returns {1} if the piece at the position of
					   #	this pos object is white. It returns a {2} if the
					   #	piece is black. It returns an empty set if this 
					   #	position is currently empty.
					   # Q2:Why would we want to do that?
					   # A2:Recall that sets impose a partial order (Lectures
					   #	7&8 Slide #95).
					   #	Well, I want pos to have a partial order too: empty
					   #	positions are Less Than filled ones. And if two
					   #	position have the same color, they will both be
					   #	Less Than Or Equal to (<=) each other.
					   #	Thus two spots are equal if they have the same
					   #	color.
					   #	But the order is partial. Neither Black nor White
					   #	is less than or equal to the other.
					   # Q3:Why would I want to do all of that?
					   # A3:Well, we aren't going to reimplement the previous
					   #	homework. But, if we did, the comparison operators
					   #	would create cleaner code.
					   # Q4:But why do we need toAset()?
					   # A4:We'll compare the toAset answers for different
					   #	positions to determine our comparison answers.

	...9... # These methods define the following operators: <, <=, ==, !=, >=,
			# >, and "in".
			# You just use the corresponding set operator.
			# But there is one detail: the color that is passed in (that is,
			# passed in so that it can be compared to the color of the piece
			# at this position) will not be a set, it will be number: either
			# 1 for white, 2 for black, or None for empty.
			# And this detail creates a complication: you can easily turn a 1
			# into a {1} and 2 into a {2}, but {None} is not the empty set.
			# the solution is understand how the subtraction operator works on
			# sets (Lecture 7&8, Slide #94) and to use one (ie, use a '-') to
			# turn {None} into an empty set.
			# Note: You have to think about what you are doing here. In the
			#	   end, however, the code to do it is quite short, and is
			#	   the same for each of the methods you'll implement here.

		try:

		...10...: # The idea here is a little odd. We don't remove this pos
				  # object (after all, this object contains nothing but a
				  # coordinate position). No, the thing that we want to remove
				  # is the chess piece at this coordinate position.
				  # We want to remove it from the dictionary that it is in
				  # (which means either W or B.)
				  # But there are some rules:
				  #  1. You have to use "try" and just try removing it from
				  #	 the dictionaries without testing first whether it is
				  #	 in them.
				  #  2. Before deleting it, save it to a variable.
				  #  3. Return an object belonging to the class "piece" (which
				  #	 we've defined above. This object holds the character
				  #	 symbol for the chess piece and a color code (1 for
				  #	 white, 2 for black).
				  #  4. If there is no piece at this position, return: None.

	def __ilshift__(self,pos_):
		...11...: # This method defines the <<= operator (logical shift left).
				  # We, however, will not use this operator as intended by
				  # Python. For us, "x <<= y" means move the piece at position
				  # "y" to position "x".
				  # Q: And what does such a "move" mean?
				  #	1: Use some of the above-defined operators to test that
				  #	   this is a legal spot to move to, in the sense that
				  #	   the destination square is either empty or holds a
				  #	   piece of the other color.
				  #	   Note: You cannot use any "_" symbols in your code.
				  #			 Instead use the operators themselves.
				  #	   Note: In these comparisons, you are "self".
				  #	   Note: If the test fails, assert an error, with the
				  #			 FEWEST character necessary.
				  #	2: Remove it from its original home ("y" in the "x<<=y"
				  #	   example.)
				  #	   Q: And what does such a "remove" mean?
				  #	   A: Well, notice that:
				  #		   i.  "y" is also a pos object.
				  #		   ii. We have define above a remove method for pos
				  #			   objects.
				  #		   iii.That remove method had returned a value, so
				  #			   we'll need to save that returned value when
				  #			   we do the remove.
				  #	3: With the FEWEST characters possible, do an assert to
				  #	   validate that a piece was removed. (The meaning is
				  #	   this code considers it an error to try moving from
				  #	   a location that hold nothing that can be moved. (See
				  #	   the provided image file for an example of this error
				  #	   being triggered.
				  #	4: Remove any piece already at the position of yourself.
				  #	   Note: The remove method defined above wasn't upset
				  #	   if you tried removing but nothing was there: it just
				  #	   returned None.
				  #	5: Update the position of this moved piece, in either
				  #	   W or B.
				  #	6: Return True if you have just the other side's king.
				  #	   Otherwise, return False.

# The following code initializes the code:
G=board();  print(G)

# The following plays some moves. They are all legal, until the last one.
# See the provide image file for an illustration of the expected output for
# these test. That image also has a discussion of why only the last move
# fails. Further, note that you should test other cases too. For example,
# capturing the king. Note: remember that you can catch the king on the first
# move of the game, because the movement paths aren't tested for legality.
