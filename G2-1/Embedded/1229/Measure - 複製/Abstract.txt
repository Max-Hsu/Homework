The MEASURE example uses the analog inputs of the LPC21xx device
to simulate a datalogger.  

This example shows how you can use signal functions in the µVision
debugger to simulate a signal that is coming into one of the analog 
inputs of the LPC21xx.

The Measure example is described in detail in the Getting Started
User's Guide.


The MEASURE  example program is available for several targets:

Simulator: uVision Simulator for LPC2129

MCB2100:   Keil MCB2100 evaluation board with ULINK debugger
           - Application is loaded to internal Flash.
           - Switch S2 (INT1) is used as GPIO and sampled
             (jumper positions: J1= off, J7= on)
           - potentiometer POT1 is sampled as AIN0
             (jumper position: J2= on)
           - serial port COM1 parameters: 9600 baud, no parity,
             8-bits, 1 stop bit, flow control none

MCB2130:   Keil MCB2130 evaluation board with ULINK debugger
           - Application is loaded to internal Flash.
           - Switch S2 (INT1) is used as GPIO and sampled
             (jumper positions: J1= off, J7= on)
           - potentiometer POT1 is sampled as AIN1
             (jumper position: J2= on)
           - serial port COM1 parameters: 9600 baud, no parity,
             8-bits, 1 stop bit, flow control none
