Discuss the use of ironies in Kate Chopin’s “The Story of an Hour.”

I think the use of ironies is for influencing the readers ,to make them more impression;
In the novel's end , Mrs. Mallard found out her husband was not dead and all of her freedom just a blink of eyes ,and she was diagnosed it's joy that kills her.

Characterize John and his wife (the female narrator) in Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wallpaper.”

John is a practical person who thinks her wife is just in some nervous depression and needs to take the "rest cure" straightly forward but not leave her wife doing what she wants to.
